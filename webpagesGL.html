        <!-- This is my daily route to Campus-->
       <p>I drive from work to class everyday. I work in <em>Youngsville</em> so I take US 1 all the way until I get to downtown.
        From downtown it depends on what class I have but I'll either park at Partners Way parking deck on <strong>Centennial campus</strong>
        or I'll park at <em>Coliseum parking deck</em> on main campus. My whole ride from work to school is a straight shot but along 
        the way I pass by countless number of stoplights and a lot of traffic. </p>
